# one place i have some issues about is that on line 7-8 and 46-47, we're opening and closing our file
# david said on the lecture that you can do the shorthand, "with open (argv[1], "r") as filename"
# also on line 27, i'm wondering if there's a shorter way to just get the string from the list! i'll have a look at that tomorrow as wel
